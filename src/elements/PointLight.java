/**
 * The PointLight object specifies an attenuated light source at a fixed point in space that radiates light equally
 * in all directions away from the light source. PointLight has the same attributes as a Light node,
 * with the addition of location and attenuation parameters.
 * <p>
 * A point light contributes to diffuse and specular reflections,
 * which in turn depend on the orientation and position of a surface.
 * A point light does not contribute to ambient reflections.
 * <p>
 * A PointLight is attenuated by multiplying the contribution of the light by an attenuation factor.
 * The attenuation factor causes the the PointLight's brightness to decrease
 * as distance from the light source increases.
 * A PointLight's attenuation factor contains three values:
 * <p>
 * Constant attenuation
 * Linear attenuation
 * Quadratic attenuation
 * <p>
 * A PointLight is attenuated by the reciprocal of the sum of:
 * <p>
 * The constant attenuation factor
 * The Linear attenuation factor times the distance between the light and the vertex being illuminated
 * The quadratic attenuation factor times the square of the distance between the light and the vertex
 * <p>
 * By default, the constant attenuation value is 1 and the other two values are 0,
 * resulting in no attenuation.
